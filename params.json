{"name":"Eddie Garmon","tagline":"Tossing Plastic and Slinging Bits","body":"## Welcome to `MY` Pages.\r\n\r\n### Graduated Cylinder Updates\r\nI hope to get a build of [GraduatedCylinder](https://github.com/EddieGarmon/GraduatedCylinder), a measurements library for .NET on nuget soon.\r\n\r\n### Simple.Web Updates\r\nI recently started using [Simple.Web](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Web) and became enamoured. One issue that conflicted me was that I used my own explicit serialization code, no auto generation for me. This meant that I needed to create my own MediaTypeHandler. With the help of [Mark Rendle](@markrendle) and [Ian Battersby](@ianbattersby), I was able to create my own, and at the same time contribute several minor infrastructure changes back that were just released in 0.10.0.\r\n\r\n- The `IMediaTypeHandler` interface is now 100% async compatible\r\n- The `IMediaTypeHandler` interface now uses generic type parameters for `Read` and `Write`\r\n- There is a new `MediaTypeHandlerBase<TWireFormat>` that supports codec style two phase serialization. This is used by:\r\n  - The new `Simple.Web.Xml.ExplicitXmlMediaTypeHandler`\r\n  - The renamed `Simple.Web.Xml.DataContractXmlMediaTypeHandler` that was `XmlMediaTypeHandler`\r\n  - The new `Simple.Web.JsonNet.JsonMediaTypeHandler`\r\n  - The `Simple.Web.JsonNet.HalJsonMediaTypeHandler`\r\n\r\nThe renamed `Simple.Web.JsonNet.JsonMediaTypeHandlerWithDeepLinks` that was `JsonMediaTypeHandler`, has not been modified for this release.\r\n\r\nA bunch of the test infrastructure for the media type handling was also aggregated and condensed.\r\n\r\nThanks for the great framework guys, hope to contribute more in the future.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
